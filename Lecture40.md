## Pro-tem Speaker:
❖ Pro-tem  is  a  Latin  phrase  which  means “for the time being”. The Protem Speaker  is  a  temporary  speaker
appointed for a limited period of time.
❖ As provided by the Constitution, the Speaker of the last Lok Sabha vacates his office immediately before the
first  meeting  of  the  newly-elected  Lok  Sabha.  Therefore, the  President  appoints  a  member  of  the  Lok
Sabha as the Speaker Pro tem.
❖ Usually, the seniormost member is selected for the post.
❖ The President himself administers the oath to the Speaker Pro Tem.
❖ The  Speaker  Pro  Tem  has  all  the  powers  of  the  Speaker.  He presides  over  the  first  sitting  of  the  newly-
elected Lok Sabha.
❖ His main duty is
➢ To administer oaths to the new members (MPs).
➢ To conduct elections of the new Speaker.
➢ To conduct the floor test (majority test).
❖ When the new Speaker is elected by the House, the office of the Speaker Pro Tem ceases to exist. Hence, this
office is a temporary office, existing for a few days.
Role of Speaker:
❖ He/she is the presiding officer of the house.
❖ He/she has the final authority to decide if the bill is a money bill or not.
❖ He runs the house according to the rules of Lok Sabha.
❖ He /she can suspend any member of the Lok Sabha for misconduct. (same power to the chairman of the
## Rajya Sabha)
❖ He/she  can  also disqualify  any  member  under  Anti-defection  Law (Schedule  X).  (same  power  to the
chairman of the rajya sabha).
❖ He is the guardian of powers and privileges of the members, the House as a whole and its committees.
❖ He is the principal spokesman of the House, and his decision in all Parliamentary matters is final. He is
thus much more than merely the presiding officer of the Lok Sabha. He is the supreme authority within the
## House.
❖ The Speaker of the Lok Sabha derives his powers and duties from three sources, that is, the Constitution of
India,  the  Rules  of  Procedure  and  Conduct  of  Business  of  Lok  Sabha,  and  Parliamentary  Conventions
(residuary powers that are unwritten or unspecified in the Rules)



## 4
Rules for the Lok Sabha:
❖ MPs are required to adhere to certain rules of parliamentary etiquette.
➢ For  example,  the  Lok  Sabha rulebook  specifies  that  MPs  are  not  to  interrupt  the  speech  of  others,
maintain silence and not obstruct proceedings by hissing or making running commentaries during
debates.
❖ Newer forms of protest led to these rules being updated in 1989.
❖ Now, members cannot shout slogans, display placards, tear up documents in protest, and play a cassette or a
tape recorder in the House.
❖ Rajya Sabha has similar rules.
❖ To  conduct  the  proceedings  smoothly,  the  rulebook  also  gives  certain  similar  powers  to  the  presiding
officers of both Houses.
❖ The  presiding  officer  of  each  House  can direct  an  MP  to  withdraw  from  the  legislative  chamber for
grossly disorderly conduct.
❖ The MP then has to remain absent from the proceedings of the House for the remainder of the day.
❖ The presiding officers can also “name” an MP for “persistently and wilfully obstructing the business”
of the House.
❖ In such a case, usually, the Parliamentary Affairs Minister moves a motion for suspending the offending
MP from the service of the House. The suspension can last until the end of the session.
Rules Regarding Suspension of the Members:
❖ The chairman may, if he deems it necessary, name a member who disregards the authority of the Chair
or abuses the rules of the council by persistently and willfully obstructing the business thereof.
❖ If  a  member  is  so  named  by  the  Chairman,  he  shall  forthwith  put  question  on  a  motion  being  made,  no
amendment,  adjournment  or  debate  being  allowed,  that  the  member  (naming  him)  be  suspended  from  the
service of the Council for a period not exceeding the remainder of the Session:
➢ Provided  that  the  council  may,  at  any  time,  on  a  motion  being  made  resolve  that  such  suspension  be
terminated.
➢ A member suspended under this rule shall forthwith quit the precincts of the council.
Lok Sabha Rule for Suspension:
❖ In 2001, the Lok Sabha rule was amended to give the Speaker one additional power.
❖ A new rule, 374A, empowers the Speaker to automatically suspend an MP for a maximum of five days
for disrupting the business of the House.
➢ ➢ In 2015, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan used this rule to suspend 25 Congress MPs.



## 5
Disruption and Suspension:
❖ The   first   instance   occurred   in 1963. A   few   Lok   Sabha   MPs   first   interrupted   President   Sarvapalli
Radhakrishnan and then walked out while he was delivering the joint address to both Houses.
❖ Lok  Sabha  ended  up  reprimanding  these  MPs.  In 1989,  63  MPs  were  suspended  from  Lok  Sabha  on  the
discussion of the Thakar Commission report.
❖ More recently in 2010, 7  MPs  were  suspended  from  Rajya  Sabha for snatching the women’s reservation
bill from the minister.
❖ Since then, MPs have raised slogans, used pepper spray in the House and displayed placards.
❖ Former  President  K  R  Narayanan, who also chaired Rajya Sabha from 1992-97, explained the difficulty
involved:
❖ “In most cases, disorders in the House arise out of a sense of frustration felt by members due to lack of
opportunities  to  make  his  point,  or  clear  his  chest  of  grievances  of  the  people  that  move  him  or  out  of  the
heat  of  the  moment.  They  are  perhaps  easier  to  deal  with.  What  is  more  difficult  to  tackle  is  planned
parliamentary offenses and deliberate disturbances for publicity or for political motives”
❖ In  2001,  during  a  national  conference  in  the Central Hall  of  Parliament organised  on  the  issue  of
disruptions, different political leaders summed up their positions.
❖ Prime  Minister Atal  Bihari  Vajpayee said  the  majority  party  is  responsible  for  governing  and  should  take
other parties into confidence.
❖ He  said  the  Opposition should  play  a  constructive  role  in  Parliament and  be  allowed  to  put  forward  its
views and express itself in a dignified manner.
Panel of Presiding Officers (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha):
❖ This idea of a panel of presiding officers is not mentioned in the constitution.
❖ Under  the Rules  of  Lok  Sabha, the  Speaker  nominates  from  amongst  the  members a  panel  of  not  more
than  ten  chairpersons. Any  of  them  can preside  over  the  House  in  the  absence  of  the  Speaker  or  the
## Deputy Speaker.
❖ He has the same powers as the Speaker when so presiding.
❖ He holds office until a new panel of chairpersons is nominated.
❖ When  a  member  of  the  panel  of  chairpersons  is  also  not present, any  other  person  as  determined  by  the
House acts as the Speaker.
❖ Note: It  must  be emphasized  here  that  a  member  of  the  panel  of  chairpersons cannot  preside  over  the
House, when the office of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker is vacant.
➢ During such time, the Speaker’s duties are to be performed by such members of the House as the
President may appoint for the purpose.
❖ The panel is finalized by the house.



## 6
❖ Recently,  PT  Usha  (nominated  member  of  Rajya  Sabha)  got  her  name  in  the  panel  of  Vice-Chairpersons.
The first time a nominated member got nominated to the panel.
❖ The panel members have the same powers as the presiding officers.
Article 99 - Oath of Member of Parliament:
❖ President or any other appointed by him administers oath to the MPs.
Article 100 - Voting in the House:
❖ All  matters  in  the  House  are  decided  by  the majority  of  present  and  voting (simple  majority). Example:
The passing of bills, except constitutional amendment bill
❖ Speaker and Chairman: They will always have casting vote (will vote only in case of a tie).
❖ Quorum (minimum strength required to start a house): Ideally 10% of the members are required to start
the proceedings in the house (54 members in Lok Sabha and 25 members in Rajya Sabha).
❖ If the Quorum is not fulfilled, then the sitting of the house will be suspended by the Presiding officer.
## Article 101:
❖ No person can be a member of both houses at the same time.
❖ If an MLA is elected as an MP, then he has to resign from his MLA post, otherwise, his MP seat will become
vacant.
❖ An MP can resign to a chairman or the speaker of the respective house.
❖ The 33rd  Amendment added  a  point  in  Article  101  and gave  ultimate  power  to  the  chairman or  the
speaker with regard to the resignation of the MPs. Indira Gandhi added this inorder to save her government
from political defections.
❖ Here,  the chairman/speaker  can  deny  such  resignation if  he  is  satisfied  that  the  resignation  is  not
voluntary or genuine.
❖ The Supreme Court in various cases has held that this power of the speaker/chairman should not be used
against the will of the MPs.
❖ If any MP is absent from the house for more than 60 days without permission, he will be removed from
his seat.
## Article 102:
❖ It deals with the disqualification of the members of Parliament.
❖ Following are the conditions for disqualification of the member:
➢ Office of Profit:  if he holds any office of profit under the Union or state government (except that of a
minister or any other office exempted by Parliament).
➢ Undischarged insolvent: if a person is of undischarged insolvent,  eg Vijay Malaya.
➢ Unsoundness of Mind: if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a court.



## 7
➢ Has  voluntarily  acquired  citizenship  of  any  other  country: if  he  is  not  a  citizen  of  India  or  has
voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign state or is under any acknowledgement of allegiance to
a foreign state.
Note: The above 4 disqualifications are done by the President.
❖ By any other law of the Parliament (Schedule X): This disqualification is finalized by the Speaker
Note: There  are  other  disqualifications  given  under  the Representation of People’s Act 1951. Hence,  we
can say that an MP can be disqualified constitutionally and statutorily.

Office of Profit:
❖ The term office of profit is not defined in the constitution.
❖ Prevention of Disqualification Act 1959: Only talks about the exempted post for the office of profit.
❖ Ideally, the Supreme Court in the Jaya Bachchan Case 2006 gave three grounds to test the office of profit.
➢ Test of pecuniary gains (if receiving some income)
➢ Executive nature of the office (have decisive powers).
➢  Exercise of Executive Powers given.
❖ The Delhi High Court in 2017 upheld the post of parliamentary secretary as an exemption.
Note: Parliamentary  secretary  is  not  a  constitutional  post.  It  is  equivalent  to  cabinet  rank.  Political  parties  give
such posts to appease MP/MLAs. Example: 21 parliamentary secretaries of the AAP Party in 2016.
## Article 103:
For the disqualification of MPs by the President, the Election Commission will give the opinion and the
President has to act according to the commission’s opinion.
