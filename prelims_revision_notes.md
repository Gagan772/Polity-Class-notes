• **Cannot join** any other party

## <a id="office-of-speaker-and-schedule-x"></a>Office of Speaker and Schedule X

### Issues
• Speakers accused of acting in **favor of political parties** (biased decision-making)

• Speaker acts as **quasi-judicial authority**
• Decision reviewable if malafide

### Supreme Court Suggestions (Keisham Meghachandra Case)
• Speaker should dispose case in **3 months**
• Power should be given to **tribunal** consisting of:
  - Retired SC judges, OR
  - Chief Justice of High Court, OR
  - President/Governor
• Political parties should **not issue unnecessary whips**

🔁 **Related Topics:** [Whip System](#whip-system), [Reforms & Committees](#reforms--committees)

---

## <a id="whip-system"></a>Whip System

### Definition & Origin
• **Whip** = Directions/orders by political party to members in house
• **British concept** → ensures lawmakers abide by party high command directions
• **NOT a constitutional tool** (not mentioned in Constitution)

### Objective
• Ensure **uniformity in decisions** by party members in house
• Deviation → disqualification from party → ultimately disqualification from house
• Party's high command discretion whether to take action

### Types of Whips

**1. One-line Whip:**
• Only **information** sent
• MP/MLA can **decide on their own**

**2. Two-line Whip:**
• MP/MLA acts on direction during voting
• **No specific instructions** issued

**3. Three-line Whip:**
• **Directions issued** → members should vote accordingly
• **Strictest** type

### Functions
• Ensure **smooth functioning** of house
• Ensure **discipline** in house

### Democratic Concerns
• Whips may be **against democratic decision-making** of MP/MLAs
• Usage should be **limited to certain cases**

### International Scenario

**UK & USA:**
• Use whip practice
• Also have **free voting system** → MPs can vote according to wish

**UK Specific:**
• If MP disqualified due to three-line whip → can continue as **independent member**

### Conclusion
• Whip = **effective tool** for smooth and efficient Parliament functioning

## <a id="issues-with-anti-defection-law"></a>Issues with Anti-Defection Law

**1. Affects Independence of MPs:**
• Violates **freedom of speech**
• Can't take independent stand on issues
• **Example:** USA - 7 Republican legislators voted to impeach Trump, faced no consequences

**2. Injustice to Constituencies:**
• MPs = people's representatives
• Should air grievances and speak for constituency requirements

**3. Accountability vs Efficiency:**
• Dr. B.R. Ambedkar favored **stability and accountability** over efficiency
• Adopted parliamentary form
• Weakening of anti-defection law provides **neither efficiency nor stability**

**4. Limited Deliberations:**
• Reduced quality of Parliamentary debates/deliberations
• May generate **faulty legislation** with loopholes
• Paves way for **delegated legislation**
• Renders Parliament ineffective

**5. Misuse by Speaker:**
• False dissent by speaker
• **Examples:** Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand cases

**6. Role Undermined:**
• Legislators = agents of people
• Should participate in important legislations
• Voting only on party lines **hinders primary goals**

**7. Emerging Loopholes:**
• **Example:** Post Karnataka elections
• MLAs made to resign → artificially weaken numerical strength
• By-polls held to topple government
• Discretion lies with speaker → adds complexity

**8. No Incentives:**
• Lack of accountability and speech limit
• MPs/MLAs find **no incentives** to research policies and find solutions

**9. No Barrier for Wholesale Defection:**
• Law prohibits **retail defection**
• **Not effective** for wholesale defection of legislators

**10. Issues with Merger Provisions:**
• Exception based on **number of members** (2/3rds agreed)
• **Not based on reason** behind defection

**11. Absence of Time Limit:**
• **No time limit** for Presiding Officers to decide disqualification
• Courts can intervene **only after decision made**
• **Example:** Manipur minister case
  - Speaker didn't decide for 3 years
  - SC dismissed minister
  - Court held: ideally decide within **3 months**

🔁 **Related Topics:** [Office of Speaker and Schedule X](#office-of-speaker-and-schedule-x), [Reforms & Committees](#reforms--committees)

## <a id="reforms--committees"></a>Reforms & Committees

### Way Forward
• Anti-defection law should be improved to accommodate **SC judgments**

### Reform Committees

**1. Dinesh Goswami Committee on Electoral Reforms (1990):**
• **President/Governor** should decide defection
• **NOT presiding officer**

**2. Law Commission Report (170th Report, 1999):**
• Political parties should **limit issuance of whips**
• Issue whips only when **government in danger**

**3. Election Commission Constitution Review Commission (2002):**
• Decisions under Tenth Schedule by **President/Governor**
• On **binding advice** of Election Commission

### Other Issues with Office of Speaker
• **Certification of Money Bill** → Example: Aadhaar Bill Case
• **Misuse of power** in money bills
• **Partisan nature** (acting in party's favor)

### Suggestions for Office of Speaker

**1. Continue as Speaker for Life:**
• **"Once a speaker, always a speaker"**

**2. Resign from Party:**
• Should resign from party membership post-election to speaker seat

**3. Money Bill Certification:**
• Committee of **two senior MPs** can assist speaker
• In finalizing money bill
• **Practiced in UK**

### Page Committee
• Formed by **forum of speakers**
• Suggestion: Once elected as speaker → should be given **second term uncontested** from constituency
