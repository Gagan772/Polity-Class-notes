Anti-Defection Law || Parliamentary Privileges || Devices of Parliament

Anti-Defection:
 The  term  defection  means  if any  MP/MLA  changes  his   political  party or  an  independent  MP/MLA  joins
any party post-election.
 Example : If an MP elected from BJP joins  the Congress party post-election.
 In India,  political  defection started post-1967.  It was termed as “Aya Ram, Gaya Ram”.
 The Parliament bought the 52nd Ame ndme nt 1985 (Sche dule  X). However, the issue of defection remains a
major  issue till  date.
 The 52nd  Ame ndme nt  1985 to the Constitution added the Te nth  Sche dule which  laid  down the process by
which  legis lators  may  be  disqualified  on  grounds  of  defection.  The  main  intent  of  the  law  was  to combat
“the evil of political defections”
 The Te nth Sche dule ensures the stability  of the political  system.
 It  contains  the  follow ing provis ions for  the  disqua lification  of  Members  of  Parliament  and  the  state
legislatures  on  the ground  of defection:
 Me mbe rs  of  Political  Parties : If  S/he voluntarily  gives   up  his   me mbe rs hip of  such  politica l  party;  or
abs tains   from  voting in  such  House  (defies  the  whip)  contrary  to  any  direction  issued  by his  political
party without  obtaining  prior  permission  of such party
 Inde pende nt  Me mbe rs : An  independent  member  of  a  House  becomes  disqualified if  he   joins   any
political party  afte r s uch e lection.
 Nominate d Membe rs : A nominated member of a House becomes disqua lified for being a member of the
House  if  he  joins  any  politica l  party afte r  the expiry  of  s ix  months from  the  date  on  which  he  takes  his
seat in  the House
 The Spe ake r/Chairman is the final  authority to decide about disqualification  of a member.

The  Cons titution (Fifty-Se cond Amendment) Act, 1985:
 The statement of object and purpose of the Act said that the evil of  political  defections has been a matter of
national  concern.  If  it  is  not  combated,  it  is  like ly  to unde rmine  the  ve ry  foundations  of  our  de mocracy
and the  principle s which sustain it.
 It  said  that  an  elected  member  of Parliament  or  a  State  Legis lature,  who  has  been elected  as a candidate  set
up  by  a  political  party  and  a  nominated  member  of Parliament  or  a  State  Legis lature  who  is  a  member  of a
political  party  at  the  time , he   takes  his  se at or  who  becomes  a  me mbe r  of  a  political  party  within  s ix
months  afte r he  take s his  seat.
 He/She would be disqualified on the ground of defection  if he voluntarily re linquis hes his  me mbe rs hip of
s uch a political party or votes or abs tains  from voting in s uch House contrary to any dire ction of s uch
party or is expelled  from such party.
 An inde pe nde nt  me mbe r of  Parliament  or  a  State  Legislature  shall  a lso  be dis qualifie d  if  he   joins  any
political party  afte r his  e le ction.



## 3
 A nominate d  membe r of Parliament or  a  State  Legislature  who  is  not  a  member  of a  politica l  party  at  the
time  of  his  nomination  and  who  has  not  become a  member  of  any  political  party be fore  the  expiry  of  s ix
months  from the date on which he takes his seat shall be disqua lified  if he joins any politica l party after the
expiry  of the said period  of six  months.
 The  Act  also  made  suitable provis ions   with  res pect  to  s plits   in,  and  me rge rs   of,  political  parties. A
special  provis ion  has  been  included  in  the  Act  to  enable  a  person  who  has  been  elected  as  the  presiding
officer of a House to sever his  connections with  his  political  party.
 The  question  as  to  whether a  member  of  a  House  of Parliament  or  State  Legislature  has  become  subject  to
the  proposed  disqualification  w ill  be de te rmine d  by  the  pres iding  office r  of  the  House; where  the
question  is  with  reference  to  the  presiding  officer  himself,  it  will  be  decided  by  a  member  of  the  House
elected by  the House in  that behalf.
Exceptions in Schedule X:
 In case of a merger of two political  parties,  there will  not  be a defection.
 If two-thirds (origina lly  it  was  one-third  which  was  later  changed  through  91st  amendment  act)    of  the
MP/MLA of any political  party joins  anothe r political party,  it  is not  a defection.
 The Spe ake r,  De puty  Spe ake r  and  De puty  Chairman do  not  fall  under  the  Tenth  Schedule  of  the
Constitution.  [Note:  To  ensure  that  they  are  not  taking  decis ions  according  to  the  political  party  (to  ensure
the non-partisan  nature of the office)].
 The Presiding Officers can res ign  from  the ir  political  party  and  can  re main  inde pe nde nt  till  the  res t
of the  te rm (but can't join  any other political  party).
 Schedule  X  says  that  the  judic iary  is  barred  to  interfere  in  these  matters.  But  the  Supreme  Court  in  the
Kihoto Hollohan cas e has held that it  can interfere and give  decisions  in  Schedule  X matters.
Office  of Spe ake r and Xth Sche dule :
 The Speakers have been accused of acting in  favor of their  political  parties (i.e., biased in  decision  making).
 The Supreme Court in the Kihoto Holohan case  and Kais ham Meghchand case  (2020) has held that under
Schedule  X,  the Spe ake r acts  as  a quas i-judicial  authority,  hence  his  decis ion  can  be  reviewed  by  the
Court if  they are of malafide  inte ntion.
Sugge stions of Supre me  Court for Sche dule  X:
 Ke is ham Meghachandra Cas e:
 The Speaker should  dispose  off the case in thre e  months .
 This  power  of  disqualification  should  be  given  to  a tribunal consisting  of  retired  SC  judges  or  the  Chief
Justice of the High  Court,  else it  can also  be given  to the President/Governor.
 The political  parties should  not issue unnecessary whips.
## Whip:
 The term Whip  means giving dire ctions  or orders  by a political party to its  me mbe rs  in the  house.
 The  whip  is  a Britis h  concept which  ensures  that  the  lawmakers are abiding  by  the  directions  of  the  party's
high  command.
 It is not  a constitutional  tool  (it is not me ntione d in the  Constitution).



## 4
Obje ctive of Whip:
 The  Whip  is  issued  to e ns ure  uniformity  in  the   de cis ions   take n  by  the   me mbe rs of  the  political  party  in
the house.
 Deviation from the whip will result in disqua lification from party membership and ultimate ly disqua lification
from the house. It is the party's high command. To take action aga inst or not  is the discretion  of the political
party.
Type  of Whips :
 Usually,  there are three kinds  of whip:
 One  line  whip: Only  information  is sent, but  the MP/PLA can decide on their  own.
 Two line  whip: MP/MLA acts on the direction  during  voting,  but no  specific instructions  are issued.
 Three  line  whip: Directions  are  issued  so  that  members  of  the  party s hould vote  accordingly  (it  is  the
strictest one).

Functions  of Whip:
 To ensure the smooth functioning  of the house.
 To ensure discipline  in  the house.
Whip  and its  Conflict with De mocratic Functioning:
 Q: Are  Whips  agains t the  concept of de mocracy?
 In  the  recent  scenario,  we  have  seen  an  increase  in  the  issuance  of  whips.  Such  whips  are agains t  the
de mocratic de cision-making of MP/MLAs.
 Hence, the usage of whips  should  be made limited  to certain cases.
Inte rnational Sce nario:
 Countries like the UK and USA have been using the whip  practice, but they have also given the ir MPs a free
voting  system i.e. they can cast their vote according  to their wish.
 In  the  case  of  the  UK,  if  an  MP  is  dis qualified  because  of  a  three-line  whip,  he  can continue  as  an
inde pe ndent me mber of parliame nt.
 Hence,  we  can  say  that  the  Whip  has  been a  very effective  tool  which  has  remained  necessary  to  ensure
the smooth and efficient functioning  of the Parliament.
Importance  of Anti-De fe ction Laws :
 Ens ure   Stability: Anti-defection  provides  stability  to  the  government   by  preventing  shifts  of  party
allegiance.



## 5
 Incre ases  Faith: Anti-defection  ensures  that candidates  elected with  party  support  and  on  the  basis  of  party
manifestos remain  loyal  to the party policies.
 Party  Dis cipline : Anti-defection promotes party discipline.
 Incre as es Public Trus t: It prevents breach of trust of people  due to defection. Ensures stability.
 Re duce d  Horse-trading: Anti-defection  law  was  brought  to  curb  the  power  of  money  after  the  election
within the house. [The horse-trading and unstable government caused by money power and bribery were said
to be rampant in  the cross-voting].
 Re duce  Mone y  Powe r: It  has  succeeded  in  reduc ing  the  money  power  within  house  voting  for  passing
legislation  and the survival  of the government.
 Overall,  it  was  introduced  to  maintain  the  rule  of  law,  and  reduce  political  corruption,  and  bribery.  This
provis ion  restricts  individua l  decision-making  and  mandates  a  faithful  adherence  to  the  directions  of  the
party whip  and solves the money-muscle  power issue in  the system.
Is s ues with Anti-de fection Law:
 Affe cts   the   Inde pe nde nce   of  the   MPs: It  violates  their  freedom  of  speech  and  they  can't  take  any
independent stand over issues. Even in the USA, when a motion was brought up against Mr Trump’s
impeachment,  seven legislators  of the Republican  Party voted to impeach  him  and faced no consequences.
 Injus tice  to  the  Cons titue ncies : Those who  have  elected  them  in  the  elections.  Being  the  people’s
representatives, they should be allowed to boldly air their grievances and speak up for their constituencies’
requirements.
 Accountability  vs  Efficie ncy: Dr  B  R  Ambedkar,  while  drafting  the  constitution,  favoured  stability  and
accountability  over  efficiency  thus  adopting  the  parliamentary  form  of  government.  The  weakening  of  anti-
defection law neither  provides  efficiency nor stability.
 Limite d  De libe rations: They  have  indeed  reduced  the  quality  of  Parliamentary  debates/deliberations.  It
could  in the long run generate faulty  legis lation w ith various  loopholes. It could a lso pave way for de legated
legislation  rendering  Parliament ineffective in  the long  run.
 Mis use  of  Law  by  the  Spe ake r: False  dissent  by  the  speaker  on  MPAs as  seen  in  the  cases  of Arunachal
Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
 Role of  MPs  and MLAs  are  Unde rmine d: The legis lators are tasked with the task of acting as an agent of
people  and  partic ipating  in  important  legis lations.  But  when  they  vote  only  on  party  lines,  it  hinders  the
primary  goals.
 Eme rging  Loopholes: Post  Karnataka  elections ,  MLAs  were  made  to  resign  to  artific ially  weaken  the
numerical  strength  and  by-polls were  held  to  topple  the  government.  As  the  discretion  lies  with  the  speaker
this  also tends to add complexity  in  the issue.
 No  ince ntives: Due  to  a  lack  of  accountability  and  limit  on  speech  and  expression,  MPs/MLAs  find  no
incentives  to research and understand policies  and to find  solutions  to various  issues.
 No  barrie r  for  Wholes ale De fe ction: The law prohibits retail defection but  is not so effective in the case of
Wholesale  defection of legislatures.
 Iss ues  with Me rge r Provisions : The flaw seems to be that the exception  is based on the number of members
(if  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  members  of  the  legislative  party  concerned  have agreed)  rather  than  the  reason
behind  the defection.



## 6
 Abse nce of Time  Limit for the  Action Taken by the  Spe ake r/Chairman: There is no time limit as per the
law  within  which  the  Presiding  Officers  should  decide  on  a  plea  for  disqualification.  The  courts  also  can
intervene  only  after  the  officer  has  made  a  decision.  Example :  Recently,  the  Supreme  Court  dismissed  a
minister  in Manipur  when  the  Speaker  did  not  decide  the  defection  petition  against  him  even  after  three
years.  The  court  held  that  ideally,  Speakers  should  take  a  decision  on  a  defection  petition  within  three
months.
## Way  Forward:
 Anti-defection  law should  be improved to accommodate the judgements  of the Supreme Court.
Othe r Re forms :
 Dines h  Gos wami  Committee  on  Electoral  Re forms   (1990): It  says  that  the  President/  Governor  should
decide the defection (not the presiding  officer).
 Law  Commiss ion  Re port  (170th  Re port, 1999): Political  Parties  should  limit  the  issuance  of  whips,  they
should  only  issue whips when the government  is  in  danger.
 Ele ction  Commiss ion  Cons titution  Revie w  Commiss ion  (2002): Decisions  under  the  Tenth  Schedule
should  be made by the President/Governor on  the binding  advice of the Election  Commission.
Othe r Is sues with the  Office  of Spe aker:
 Certification  of Money Bill,  for example,  the Aadhaar Bill  Case
 Misuse of power in  case of money  bills.
 Partisan nature of the office (acting in party’s favor).
Sugge stions for the  Office  of Spe aker:
 S/he an continue  as a speaker for life (once  a s peaker, always  a s pe aker).
 S/he  s hould re s ign from party membership  post-election  to the speaker seat.
 In  case  of  certification  of  the  money  bill, a  committee  of  two  senior  MPs  can  be  appointed  to  assist  the
speaker in  finalizing  the money  bill  (practiced in  UK).
## Page  Committee
 It was formed by  a forum of speakers.
 Once  a  legis lator  is  elected  as  a  speaker,  he/she  should  be  given  a  second  term  uncontested  from  his/her
constituency.
## Article  104:
 Pe nalty for sitting  and voting  in  the house without  taking  the oath.
Article  105 - Parliame ntary Privile ges:
 Parliamentary  privileges  are  special  rights,  immunities,  and  exemptions  enjoyed  by  the  two  Houses  of
Parliament,  their committees,  and their  members to ensure effective and efficient  functioning.



## 7
 It is borrowed from the Britis h s ystem, and these privileges ensure the protection  of lawmakers.
 According  to Article  105  and 194, the  powers,  privileges,  and  immunities  of  Parliament  and  MPs  are  to  be
defined  by the Parliament. Howe ver, no law has  s o far be e n enacted in this  re spect.
Parliame ntary  Privile ges and Evolution:
 In Britis h  parliame nt: It was  introduced  to  prevent  the arrest and  harassment  of  legislators  in  the  House  of
Commons  when they criticized  the crown.
 The   Indian  s tory: Our  founding  fathers  provided  the  parliamentarians  absolute  freedom  of  speech in  the
house while citizens’ freedom was restricted. The Supreme Court also upheld the decision based on its
respect for the legislators  who were mostly freedom fighters.
 Powe rs  to  Codify: The  founding  fathers  left  the  decision  to  codify  the  privileges  on the  wisdom  of
Parliament,  but  the  current  legis lators  felt  the  codification  would  take  away  the  sovereignty  of  Parliament.
They  even  went  on  to  argue  they  do  not  constitute  civil  servants.  However,  it  was  struck  down  in  P  V
## Narasimha Rao Case.
Type s  of Privile ges:
##  Individual  Privileges
##  Collective  Privileges

Colle ctive Privileges:
 Collective  privileges  are for maintaining  the dignity of the  hous e.
 These privileges belong  to the House of Parliament colle ctively.
 It has the right to publis h its  re ports , de bates and procee dings  and also the right to prohibit othe rs  from
publishing  the same.
 It can e xclude strangers from its proceedings and hold s e cret s ittings to discuss some important  matters.
 It can  make   rules to re gulate   its  own  proce dure and  the conduct  of  its   bus iness and  to  adjudicate  upon
such matters.



## 8
 It can  punis h  me mbe rs   as  we ll  as  outs ide rs for  breach  of  its  privileges  or  its  contempt  by  reprimand,
admonition  or imprisonment  (also suspension  or expulsion,  in  case of members).
Powe rs  in Bre ach of Privile ges:
 In case of breach of privileges,  the Parliament can punish  the members and the outsiders for its  contempt.
Se cre t Sitting:
 A  sitting  of  the  Parliament  or  Legis lative  Assembly  in  which  only  the  members  are  allowed  to  s it.  The
presiding  officer decides about the secret sitting. (Secret Sitting  is mentioned  in  the Rules of the House)
 In  2007,  a  secret  sitting  was  conducted  in  the  Chhattisgarh  assembly.  The  report  of  this  sitting  never  comes
in  public.
Pre vious  Year Que stion:
The ‘Powers, Privileges and Immunities of Parliament and its members’ as envisaged in Article 105 of the
Constitution  leave room for a  large number of un-codified and unenumerated privileges to continue’. Assess the
reasons  for  the  absence  of  the  legal  codification  of  parliamentary  privileges.  How  can  this  problem  be
addressed? (2014)
